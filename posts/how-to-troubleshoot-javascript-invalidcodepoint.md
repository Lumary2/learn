browserTitle: RangeError, Invalid code point in JavaScript error handling
type: posts
---

If you are working in JavaScript, and receive the following error, your code is using an invalid value with the method String.fromCodePoint().

<Highlighter
input={`RangeError: {0} is not a valid code point
RangeError: Invalid code point {0}`}
language='javascript'
/>

{0} is a placeholder for the value you used as an argument in the String.fromCodePoint() method. The argument passed to the method needs to be a value in the Unicode codespace, which is in the range of integers from 0 to 0x10FFFF (1114111).

Depending on the browser, the message of the error will vary between the outputs described before.

In this tutorial, we'll reproduce the issue and then go over some solutions.

## Reproducing the error

Let's execute the following code in a JavaScript console. In this example, we will pass -1 to the method, which will throw the error.

<Highlighter
input={`String.fromCodePoint(-1); //RangeError: -1 is not a valid code point`}
language='javascript'
/>

In this second example, we will use 9733 as the argument and a star will appear as expected.

<Highlighter
input={`String.fromCodePoint(9733); //â˜…`}
language='javascript'
/>

Now that we have been able to reproduce the error, let's go over possible solutions.

## Check before passing

We can avoid the exception by checking the value of the codePoint inside of an `if-statement`.

```javascript
var codePoint=1114111;

if(codePoint>=0&&x<1114112){
String.fromCodePoint(codePoint); 
}

else{
console.log("The argument passed to fromCodePoint() method is not in the valid range(0 to 1114111)")
}
```  

If the code point is not in the valid range, the log message inside of the else-statement will be printed to the console. Depending on your programs requirements, you could also enclose the if/else-statement in a loop, so that the user can then enter a valid code point.   

## Exception handling

A second approach is to handle the exception with a `try` / `catch` clause that catches the error.

```javascript
var x=-1;

try{
console.log(String.fromCodePoint(x)); 
}

catch(error){
  console.log("The argument passed to fromCodePoint() method is not in the valid range(0 to 1114111)")
}
```

This program will throw the `RangeError invalid code point` and then fetch it in the catch clause. The described log message will be shown to the user.
